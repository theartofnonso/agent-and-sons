Agent & Sons website built with Next.js (App Router) and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

1) Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2) Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the site.

Edit `src/app/page.tsx` to change the landing content. Global styles live in `src/app/globals.css`. Layout and navigation are in `src/app/layout.tsx`.

## Deploy

Deploy on Vercel. Set the framework to Next.js and import the repo; default settings work.
